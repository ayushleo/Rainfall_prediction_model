# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether it will rain on a given day based on meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.  
It applies **Machine Learning techniques** to classify rainfall occurrence, using **Random Forest Classifier** for accurate and reliable predictions.
